**Title**: 001 - Project Initialization with Vite and React TypeScript

**Problem Statement**:
We need to set up a new React TypeScript project using Vite as the build tool, following the project's architectural and development conventions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
Given a new project directory
When initializing the project
Then:

- A new Vite project with React and TypeScript should be created
- The project structure should follow the defined architecture
- All necessary dependencies should be installed
- TypeScript configuration should be properly set up with strict mode
- Basic project files (index.html, App.tsx, main.tsx) should be created
- Git should be initialized with proper .gitignore
- README.md should be created with project setup instructions

**Solution Overview**:

- Initialize new Vite project with React and TypeScript template
- Set up project structure according to architecture:
  - /public for static assets
  - /src for application source code
  - /src/components for reusable UI components
  - /src/hooks for custom hooks
  - /src/styles for styling
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode
- Set up initial components following SOLID principles
- Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore
- Create comprehensive README.md

**Testing**:

- Verify that the development server starts successfully
- Ensure hot module replacement (HMR) works
- Confirm TypeScript compilation works without errors
- Validate that the project structure matches the architecture requirements

# Context Documentation

## Project Background

- This is a simple counter application built using Vite.
- The project serves as a demonstration for using Cursor to generate code efficiently with proper context.
- The counter will be a frontend-only application with basic increment and decrement functionalities.
- The goal is to showcase AI-assisted development by providing context-aware code generation.

## Target Audience

- Developers who want to see how AI tools like Cursor can assist in generating frontend code.
- Individuals looking for a simple and fast way to build a web-based counter using Vite.
- The project is not meant for production use but as an educational and exploratory tool.

## Use Cases / Features

- **Basic Counter Operations:**
  - Increment (+1)
  - Decrement (-1)
  - Reset to zero

- **User Interface:**
  - A display area to show the current count.
  - Buttons to increment and decrement the count.
  - A "Reset" button to reset the counter to zero.

- **Keyboard Support:**
  - Users should be able to use their keyboard to increment and decrement the counter.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - The counter should work well on desktop and mobile screens.

- **Performance Considerations:**
  - Ensure the app remains lightweight and fast.
  - Minimal dependencies, leveraging Viteâ€™s fast build system.

- **Extensibility (Optional Enhancements):**
  - Implement additional features like setting a custom increment step.
  - Add support for dark mode.
  - Local storage support to persist the counter value.

## Technical Considerations

- **Technology Stack:**
  - Vite (for fast development and build process)
  - React (for UI components, if needed)
  - Vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript for core logic
  - CSS for styling (or TailwindCSS for utility-first styling)

- **Deployment:**
  - No deployment is currently in plan.
  - Should support fast loading and efficient rendering.

- **AI-Assisted Development Focus:**
  - Context will be provided to AI (Cursor) to generate structured code.
  - Ensuring AI-generated code adheres to best practices.
  - Demonstrating how AI can accelerate frontend development while maintaining quality and maintainability.

## Summary

This project serves as a practical example of how AI tools can assist in frontend development. By setting clear expectations and providing the right context, we ensure that AI-generated code aligns with our project needs while keeping the development process efficient and structured.

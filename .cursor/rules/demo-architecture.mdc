# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the Counter application built using Vite. It describes the structure, key components, and interactions within the system to ensure maintainability, scalability, and performance.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React (or Vanilla JavaScript)
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** CSS or TailwindCSS
- **State Management:** React useState (if using React)
- **Testing:** Playwright for end-to-end testing
- **Deployment:** Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages

## Project Structure

```

## Component Breakdown

### 1. **Counter Component**
- Displays the current count.
- Provides buttons to increment, decrement, and reset the count.

### 2. **Button Component** (Optional)
- Reusable button component with customizable styles and behavior.

## State Management
- Uses React's `useState` hook to manage the count.
- Optionally, local storage can be used to persist the counter state.

## Event Handling
- Button clicks trigger state updates.
- Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Arrow Up/Down) can be added for accessibility.

## Testing Strategy
- **Playwright Tests:**
  - Ensure UI components render correctly.
  - Validate increment, decrement, and reset functionality.
  - Test keyboard accessibility features.
  - Verify state persistence (if implemented with local storage).

## Performance Considerations
- The application is lightweight, leveraging Vite for fast builds and hot module replacement (HMR).
- Minimal re-renders by optimizing state updates.

## Deployment Strategy
- There is no deployment planned for this application yet.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement dark mode.
- Add a feature to customize the increment/decrement step.
- Introduce unit tests for components.

## Summary
This document provides a structured overview of the Counter app's architecture, ensuring clarity in development, maintenance, and future scalability.
